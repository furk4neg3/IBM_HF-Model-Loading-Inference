# Loading Models and Inference with Hugging Face

This project explores how to load and perform inference with pretrained models using the Hugging Face `transformers` library. Using models like DistilBERT and GPT-2, we carry out text classification and text generation tasks. This project also highlights the simplicity of the Hugging Face `pipeline()` function for efficient NLP model inference.

## Overview

This lab project demonstrates:
- Loading and tokenizing input text for model inference
- Performing text classification and text generation using Hugging Face models
- Comparing traditional inference with the Hugging Face `pipeline()` function for streamlined deployment

## Introduction to Model Loading

In this section, we explore loading pretrained models and tokenizing text inputs for NLP tasks. This approach enables us to use models like DistilBERT and GPT-2 without relying solely on the pipeline method.

## Text Classification with DistilBERT

Using DistilBERT, we classify text into categories. This part demonstrates setting up the model, tokenizing inputs, and processing classification outputs.

## Text Generation with GPT-2

In this section, we use the GPT-2 model to generate text. We cover input preparation, running inference, and processing generated sequences.

## Using the Hugging Face Pipeline

The `pipeline()` function in Hugging Face simplifies model loading and inference by providing an easy-to-use API for common NLP tasks like classification and generation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Hugging Face Transformers Library
- PyTorch
